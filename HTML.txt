The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

<div id="top">
<h1>Chocolate curry</h1>
<p class="intro">This is my recipe for making curry purely with chocolate</p>
<p class="intro">Mmm mm mmmmm</p>
</div>
